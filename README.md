# GP-Data-Analysis-with-RMarkdown
This repository demonstrates how RMarkdown can be used by General Practitioners (GPs) for efficient data analysis, reporting, and visualisation. It includes the RMarkdown PDF report, an in-depth PowerPoint presentation explaining the project, and the R code used for analysis and visualisations.

## Repository Contents

RMarkdown-GP-Applications.pdf: A comprehensive report generated using RMarkdown, detailing how GPs can use R for tasks such as generating reports, creating visualisations, and analysing data.
project_presentation.ppt: A PowerPoint presentation summarising the project, explaining the code, and outlining the potential benefits of RMarkdown for GPs.
RMarkdown_code.R: The R script containing the code used to generate the RMarkdown report. It includes examples of data visualisations, data summaries, and common data manipulations using dplyr.

## Data Sources

The project includes examples using built-in datasets such as ToothGrowth and airquality.
Users can easily substitute their own datasets by importing them with functions like read.csv().
